We are an open cybersecurity community for everyone, built around CTF platforms like Hack The Box and Vulnlab. From beginners to people who have been working in cybersecurity for years, everyone is welcome.

If you're looking for people to play CTFs with, improve your skills, exchange knowledge, and learn together with others who share the same passion for cybersecurity, you are more than welcome to join us.

However, an interest in CTFs is not necessary to have a good time in our community. We aim to share the latest news on offensive and defensive topics, as well as tools, TTPs, career development, and training opportunities related to the cybersecurity industry.

If this sounds like a place you want to be, feel free to get in touch with us and join us on our Discord server.
